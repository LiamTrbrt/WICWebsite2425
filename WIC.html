            <h2>CRC Robotics</h2>
            <p>CRC Robotics was founded in 2001 by a group of young professionals and teachers, fueled by their passion for robotics and education. Unsatisfied with the robotics competitions available for high schools and CEGEPs in Canada, they created an annual competition linking science, mathematics, computers, arts, and languages. Since the 2021-2022 season, CRC Robotics has also acquired a junior division, in which elementary schools across Quebec can compete!

            Weâ€™ve since grown into a non-profit organization run by former participants willing to give other students the chance to participate in the CRC Robotics adventure that has been so much fun for them. The competition now welcomes teams from coast to coast in a 3-day, action-packed event held annually, in February. We also organize other events specifically aimed toward including marginalized communities in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields.</p>
